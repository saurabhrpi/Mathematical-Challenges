### RandomNumberGenerator.py:  

  There is an ideal random number generator, which given a positive integer M can generate any real number between 0 to M, and probability density function is uniform in [0, M].  
  
  Given two numbers A and B and we generate x and y using the random number generator with uniform probability density function [0, A] and [0, B] respectively, what's the probability that x + y is less than C? where C is a positive integer.
